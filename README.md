# What is it?
This is my unity demo project.The main part is a copy of the wand building system from [Noita](https://noitagame.com/). The main purpose of it is to show examples of my code to potential employers. 
## What is wand building?
So you can place spells and modifiers in wand slots to determine in which order the spells will be cast. Multicast modifiers allow you to cast multiple spells simultaneously. Spells with triggers allow you to cast the next spell (or spells) when the spell carrier is destroyed. And all these rules can combine with each other to provide pretty interesting results. 
## Project is under construction!

For now**the  project is under construction ** so only a few spells are implemented, just to be sure that the core system works. 
Some code is temporary and ugly. Visual it is just a prototype.

# So I'm an employer, where should I look?
